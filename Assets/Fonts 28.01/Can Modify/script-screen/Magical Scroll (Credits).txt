Thank you for downloading my font!

This font is my first pixel font.

This font would look great for a retro inspired video game, which is probably why you are here.

I'm also releasing this font into the public domain, use it however you like!

(If anyone is reading this, send me and image of what you're using this font for! I'd like to see someone get a use out of this font.)

Stay Swaggy,
Borneo.
